# Show-Quick-Access-Popup
This repository contains two scripts (QuickAccessPopup.bat and QuickAccessPopup.ps1)  that guide to in making a context menu entry that will replace original "Show Quick Access Popup" entry  with a more convienent option. 


#Goal:

Make a context menu entry that detects if QAP is running; if active, send YOUR ASSIGNED hotkey, mine is ctrl+3. If the application is not running launches the application. 

#Usefulness: 
I dislike that I have to find QAP.exe if for whatever reason it gets shut off.  This swaps out the context menu to launch application if no Qap active.
